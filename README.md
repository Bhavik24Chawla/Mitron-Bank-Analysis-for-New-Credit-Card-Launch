### The objective is to analyze data and provide actionable, data-driven recommendations to guide Mitron Bank in tailoring the new credit cards to customer needs and market trends.


#### Analysis: 

•	The occupation of most of the customers is Salaried IT which represents more than 33% of our customers.

•	60K-70K is the average monthly salary of the customers where average monthly spending is most. Salaried IT employees represent more than 80% of the customers belonging to income range.

•	25-45 is the age group where spending is most. Also, their spent through credit card is highest.

•	Married customers spend more than Single customers.

•	Customers spend more than 42% of their monthly incomes in different categories. Bills is the topmost category followed by Groceries, Electronics and many more.

•	Travel is the category where more than 44% is paid through Credit Card.

#### Recommendations:

•	Our Target Customers should be Salaried IT employees as their average monthly spend is higher and belong to higher monthly income range.

•	Our key category should be Food and Groceries. Only 31% and 35% is paid through credit card in Groceries and Food category respectively.

•	To target these categories, we should tie up with quick commerce giants and food delivery apps and add discounts or reward points or cashbacks.

•	For Beta testing, we can target Delhi NCR where average monthly spent and payment through Credit Card is comparatively good.

•	We can also add our Credit Card on UPI.
